# Task Details 
_Anirudh Sathish_

1. Download any Multi Dimensional Classification Dataset from UCI repository.
2. Ignore the class labels and perform Clustering.
3. Experiment with various clustering techniques (Agglomerative , Kmeans...) and number of clusters (3 cluster, 4 clusters, ...)
4. Check and compare the performance with ground truth using Rand Index (RI) and Adjusted Rand Index (RAI) metrics.


## Dataset Specifications 
- The Echocardiogram dataset was downloaded from the UCI repository 
- Link to the above dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Echocardiogram

## Task Progress walkthrough 
### Phase 1 
- Data Cleaned 
### Phase 2 
- KNN Clustering performed on cluster sizes 2,3,4,5,7
- Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index computed for the same comparing it with the ground truth 
### Phase 3 
- Agglomerative clustering performed on cluster sizes 2,3,4,5,7
- Rand Index and Asjusted Rand INdex computed for the same comparing it with the ground truth
